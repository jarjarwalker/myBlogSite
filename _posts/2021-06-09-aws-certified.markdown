I made the decision to embark on a career in the cloud a few years ago. However, it wasn’t until last year when I heard about Linux Academy that I really started my journey. I just happened to be listening to a tech podcast and I heard about the hands-on training and the other practical experience that Linux Academy offered. Didn’t take me too long to sign up and once I did, I was fully committed to my journey.

I started on a Junior AWS Cloud Engineer learning path. That introduced me to Linux and Bash and I thoroughly enjoyed the courses and hands-on Labs where I was able to practise what I learnt in Sandbox environments.

After completing the Linux Essentials course and writing the exam to get my LPI essentials certificate. I completed other Cloud fundamental courses and AWS fundamentals and now finally I was to begin the AWS SAC01 prep course. The course creator was Adrian Cantrill and I immediately loved his teaching style and how he covered all aspects, making sure you don’t miss a thing. 

AWS updated the Solutions Architect Associate Exam to SAC02 and because of how my brain works and the fact that  the course on Linux Academy was a AWS SAC01 prep course, I couldn’t commit myself to following an “outdated” course. Linux Academy did eventually update their course after being acquired by A Cloud Guru. However, I did not enjoy the new course, it felt rushed and it just prepared you for the exam. I wanted a course that not only prepared me for the exam, but equipped me with the right skills and practical experience to be confident in my new career path.

I reached out to Adrian(the previous course creator on Linux Academy) directly on LinkedIn and he told me he started his own learning platform at [learn.cantrill][learncantrill]. I immediately signed up and took my time completing the course. Adrian's courses are much longer compared to the one on [A Cloud Guru][acloudguru] but I thoroughly recommend it if you really want to pursue a career in AWS. It took me around 3 months to complete the new SAC02 course by Adrian and with some practice exams from [TutorialsDojo][tutorialsdojo] I was able to pass the exam on the first attempt. I still highly recommend [A Cloud Guru][acloudguru] if you want a platform that covers all aspects of the cloud, including the other cloud providers and Linux and DevOps tools.
